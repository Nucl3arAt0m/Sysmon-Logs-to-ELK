# Sysmon Logs to ELK Stack

## Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to set up a robust log management and analysis pipeline using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) integrated with Sysmon logs from Windows hosts. The solution enables real-time collection, ingestion, and visualization of security-relevant Windows event logs.

## What I Have Done

- Installed and configured **Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, and **Kibana** on a Debian-based system.
- Secured Elasticsearch communication via SSL, and enabled node clustering.
- Configured and deployed the **Elastic Agent** on Windows to collect Sysmon logs.
- Configured Sysmon on Windows with an advanced event tracing configuration.
- Created custom Kibana dashboards to visualize security events and system activity.
- Demonstrated knowledge of:
  - Secure ELK stack deployment and configuration
  - Windows event log collection using Elastic Agent and Sysmon
  - Log parsing, indexing, and visualization best practices
  - Querying logs in Kibana using KQL (Kibana Query Language)

## Key Skills Showcased

- Cross-platform expertise: Linux-based ELK stack setup and Windows Sysmon configuration
- Infrastructure setup using Linux command line and systemd for service management
- Security-conscious deployment: SSL/TLS for encrypted Elasticsearch communications
- Hands-on experience with modern logging and monitoring toolchain
- Data visualization and dashboard creation in Kibana
- Automation capability via configuration files and enrollment tokens

## How to Use

1. Setup Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana on your Debian system.
2. Configure Sysmon on your Windows machines with the provided XML configuration.
3. Deploy the Elastic Agent to forward logs securely to Elasticsearch.
4. Import or create Kibana dashboards to analyze event logs visually.
